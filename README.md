# Parallel computing exercises
This repository includes exercises for practicing parallel computing.
The difficulty of the exercises is increasing: starting from the classic HelloWorld, up to the sorting algorithm (OddEvenSort).

# Compile and Run the exercises:
To compile: gcc -fopenmp -o name-executable name-code.c
To run: ./name-executable

if you want, you can change the environment variables: export OMP_NUM_THREAD=2 (this command must be entered before running the executable)
